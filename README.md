### Who are they?
**Code Hipsters** (or CH) â€” is a non-profit IT-community with a mission to spread knowledge about brand cutting-edge trends in
open-source tools, modern *front/back/devops* development, art and design. The community was originally founded in 2014 in 
Rostov-on-Don and currently consists of:

  * [Eugeny Pshenichniy](https://github.com/ujenjt)
  * [Victor Suzdalev](https://github.com/kadmil)
  * [Alexey Taktarov](https://github.com/molefrog)
  * [Tikhon Belousko](https://github.com/dazzz)

Although these are the people who were there from the very beginning, but the whole project wouldn't be possible without 
help of [Benjamin Tambourine](https://github.com/vtambourine), [Sam Kozin](https://github.com/skozin) and others.
